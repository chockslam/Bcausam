Creating tables and charts with a WordPress tables plugin has never been easier. It only takes 3 basic steps:

**Step 1 - Provide table data**

You can provide table data for WordPress tables by uploading Excel, CSV , JSON, XML or Serialized PHP array or you will create simple table from scratch with new table builder.

**Step 2 - Customization**

You can customize and configure the columns of your WordPress table (rename, reorder, add CSS classes, hide, change colors) and also you can customize and configure table Color and Font settings( Font, Header, Table border, Row , Cell and Pagination) in any way you see fit.

**Step 3 - Publish in a post or page**

Once you are happy with the design of your WordPress table, you can easily insert it on any post or page through [Gutenberg](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/gutenberg-editor/), [standard WP Editor and shortcode](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/wpdatatables-shortcodes/), or through page builders like [Avada Page Builder](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/avada-builder-integration/), [Divi Page Builder](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/divi-builder-integration/), [WPBakery Page Builder](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/table-features/visual-composer-integration/) or [Elementor](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/general/elementor-integration/). All tables (except simple table)  will become sortable and will have pagination by default.

Additionally, each table (except simple table) can have a search bar and can have the following functions: “Copy to Clipboard”, “Export to CSV”, “Export to PDF”, “Export to XLS”. All these functionalities are configurable and it is your decision whether to toggle these on or off.

Following column data types are supported in data tables (Data tables created from Excel, CSV , JSON, XML or Serialized PHP array). Most column types, except the images, have their own sorting rules:

* String -  [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/string-columns/)
* Integer - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/integer-columns/)
* Float -   [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/float-columns/)
* Date -    [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/date-columns/)
* DateTime - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/datetime-columns/)
* Time -    [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/time-columns/)
* Image -   [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/image-columns/)
* URL link - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/url-link-columns/)
* E-mail link - [Text and video documentation](https://wpdatatables.com/documentation/column-features/e-mail-link-columns/)
