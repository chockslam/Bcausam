*** REQUEST ***

*** BUGS ***

+ After updating a table design the user (sometimes) has to reconcile to reflect the real database table structure
+ Recreate repository not working as expected on WordPress multisite
+ Cannot not use Screen Options for child tables when having more than one child tabs
+ Data Project pages not editable when a remote host is down (solution: use ajax to fill listboxes; does this apply to other plugin pages as well?)

*** LONG TERM IMPROVEMENTS ***

+ Copy project page (Gaetan)
+ Remove all schema and table names from all/get requests
+ Problem exporting large table (Tony)
  Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 805306368 bytes exhausted (tried
  > to allocate 20480 bytes) in
  > /home/customer/www/leecountyhgs.org/public_html/wp-includes/wp-db.php
  > on line 2720
+ Allow to export all rows from a Data Projects page (Manivannan )

*** WORK IN PROGRESS ***

+ Priority
  + Add default values to Data Forms
  + Make a field read-only (Forum: rvwill48)
  + Add option to disable search in Data Projects (Jim Hunter)
  + Use WordPress|plugin date format in Data Publisher and Data Forms (Joseph + Barbara + Kennie)
  + Improve autocomplete in Data Forms
  + Geolocation > update location info on update/insert
  + In data Explorer, Manage, search columns, you cannot enable search check box if the column name has a space in it. The update does not change anything. (Charles)
    + Earlier I reported that Data Explorer->Manage->settings->search settings hung if there was a space in the column name.
      Today we learned that the same thing happens if there is a ’-‘ in the table name. For example catalogue-1r2 failed/hung but a rename to catalogue_1r2 worked just fine.
